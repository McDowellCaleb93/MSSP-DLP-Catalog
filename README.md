# Microsoft DLP Graph API Policy Catalog

## Overview

This repository contains **Microsoft Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy templates** formatted for **Graph API** deployment. The policies are designed to be **industry-specific** and **AI-readiness**, covering a wide range of use cases including healthcare, banking, education, general enterprise, and AI/LLM usage. 

Each policy is organized by industry and includes a **Graph API call sample** for easy deployment into Microsoft Purview / Microsoft Compliance solutions.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

```
- Healthcare/
- Banking/
- Education/
- AI/
- General/
- OverlapBuckets/ (multi-industry shared rules)
```

Each folder contains:
- **Individual DLP Policy JSON files** ready for API deployment.
- **Graph API Call Samples (.md)** for easy use in Graph Explorer, Postman, or automation workflows.

## üìú Policy Naming Convention

Each policy file is named using the following pattern:

```
Policy_<Index>_<Policy_Name>.json
Policy_<Index>_<Policy_Name>_GraphAPI_Call.md
```

Example:
```
Policy_1_Block_PHI_sharing_externally.json
Policy_1_Block_PHI_sharing_externally_GraphAPI_Call.md
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Review and Customize

- Browse the folders to find relevant policies for your industry or use case.
- Review the JSON policy template and accompanying API call markdown file.
- Modify any fields if needed (e.g., recipient emails, thresholds, template IDs).

### Step 2: Deploy via Microsoft Graph API

#### API Endpoint

```
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/security/dataLossPreventionPolicies
```

#### Example Request Headers

```
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Example Request Body

Use the content of each `.json` file as the request body.

### Step 3: Automate with Scripts (Optional)

You can also automate deployment using PowerShell or GitHub Actions for CI/CD. (Scripts can be added in a future `/scripts/` directory).
